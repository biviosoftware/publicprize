    <h3>2015 Winner: Surya</h3>
    <div class="pp-nominee-text"><p>Run by a group of five current and former University of Colorado students, Surya Conversions designs and builds hybrid conversion kits for auto rickshaws, the three-wheeled vehicles that ply the roads of India and 35 other countries around the world.</p>
    <p>The need for a hybrid vehicle came in observance of rapidly increasing air pollution levels that profoundly affect  the livelihood of families and communities in dense urban areas, particularly in developing countries. In these areas, there is a demand for innovative solutions that can tame the unchecked sources of greenhouse gases. In India alone, it's estimated there are over 5 million auto rickshaws on the road every day carrying passengers. Converting just 10 percent of these would take 2.7 million tons of CO2 out of the air. At the same time, fuel costs - which account for over 1/3 of a driver's income - are cut by almost 30% percent.</p>
    <p>By reducing vehicle emissions and providing savings on fuel costs, Surya Conversion is working to clean the environment and reduce poverty, one rickshaw at a time.</p></div>
